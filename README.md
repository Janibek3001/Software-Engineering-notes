## Software Development lifecycle

- **_Advantages of SDLC_**
  - Improves efficiency
  - Developers know what they should do next 
  - Respond to changing requirements
  - Solve problems in early development (Can be find in the `design` phase)
  - Each team define their roles and reduces the overlapping responsibilities

- **_The phases of the SDLC_**
  1. [Planning (*Requirements*)](#planning) 
  2. [Design](#design)
  3. [Development](#development)
  4. [Testing](#testing)
  5. [Deployment](#deployment)
  6. [Maintenance](#maintenance)

- #### **_Planning (SRS)_**
  - Gathered
  - Analyzed
  - Documented  
  - Prioritized

- #### **_Design_**
  - Requirements that gathered from the SRS used for project architecture
  - During this phase, prototypes can be designed
  - Document that created in this phase is called `Design Documentation`

- #### **_Development_**
  - When Design Document is finished, developers start to write code
  - The project planners use the design document to determine and assign tasks
  - Organizations may have some guidelines to follow

  - #### **_Testing_**
    - The product must be tested to ensure stability, security and that it meet the SRS requirements
    - Bugs reported, tracked, fixed and retested

- #### **_Deployment_**
  - Deploy the code to production
  
- #### **_Maintenance_**
  - This phase happen after the Deployment phase
  - This phase helps to find any other bugs
  - Identify User interface issue
  - Find other requirements 
  - Code enhancements
